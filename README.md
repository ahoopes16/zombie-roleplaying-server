## TODO
### Development Environment/Automation
* ~~Set up linting (probably using [eslint](https://dev.to/robertcoopercode/using-eslint-and-prettier-in-a-typescript-project-53jb))~~
* ~~Set up testing (probably using [Jest](https://jestjs.io/docs/en/getting-started.html))~~
* Set up hooks for automatic linting and automatic testing when committing/pushing using [Husky](https://github.com/typicode/husky)
* Look into setting up [tsoa](https://github.com/lukeautry/tsoa) for OpenAPI-compliant REST API development
